# A simple feedforward neural network

This is a simple feedforward neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. It is
implemented in C, and uses the Intel MKL library for linear algebra operations.

The eventual goal of this project is to:

1. Improve the current implementation, both by improving the choice of
   activation and cost functions, and by tuning our hyperparameters.
2. Implement other kinds of neural networks (a convolutional neural network,
   for example).
